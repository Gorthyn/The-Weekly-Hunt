        <h1>About the Game</h1>
        <h3>
          This is a game where players take on the roles of various characters
          and embark on exciting adventures. The game is designed to encourage
          collaboration, creativity, and strategic thinking as players work
          together to overcome challenges and achieve their goals.
        </h3>
        <h1>What You've Signed Up For</h1>
        <h2>
            When you play this game, most of you will create hunters, people who have devoted their lives to killing monsters.<br/>
            One player will be the Keeper - that's short for Keeper of "Monsters and Mysteries". The Keeper will be in charge of:<br/>
        </h2>
        <h3>
            - Designing monsters and mysteries for the hunters to deal with<br/>
            - Bringing the world to life<br/>
            - Portraying the monsters and people the hunters meet.
        </h3><br/>
        <h2>
            The rest of you will decide how the hunters work together to investigate the weird situations they find, slay the monsters causing the trouble,<br/>
            and save the people in danger.<br/>
            Your hunters aren't normal people; you're not even normal monster hunters. You are the ones who stand out, larger than life and twice as badass.<br/>
            You can change the world - save it, destroy it, or alter it forever.<br/>
            One way or another, you will make a difference.
        </h2>
        <div>
            <h1>The Game is a Conversation</h1>
            <h2>
            This is an improvisational game in which you create a story together.<br/>
                The story emerges from a conversation between the players, with the<br/>
                Keeper describing the initial situation and the rest of the players<br/>
                describing what their hunters do in response. This leads into an<br/>
                ongoing back-and-forth between the Keeper and hunters, as each<br/>
                decision and action leads to a new situation, requiring new decisions<br/>
                about what happens next.<br/>
                The Keeper will describe the game's world to you, and ask questions.<br/>
                You respond to that world (with descriptions, and moves when they<br/>
                are called for), and answer those questions. Keep your agenda in mind<br/>
                as you do it.<br/>
            </h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Moves</h1>
            <h2>
            Hunters make moves to find the monster, and to kill it. Moves are<br/>
                moments of danger and uncertainty. You never know quite how they'll<br/>
                turn out.<br/>
                Your hunter's moves cover all the things you can do where the game's<br/>
                rules get involved in the story.<br/>
                Most of the time, you'll be describing what your hunter says, where<br/>
                they go, or what they do without activating a move. That goes for<br/>
                everything that a normal person could do, in situations where failure<br/>
                would not be interesting and where there's no particular danger.<br/>
                In circumstances where a normal person couldn't do what you want to<br/>
                do, or the drama of the story requires it, or it's dangerous, that's when<br/>
                the moves come in and control how well you do.<br/>
                Here are some examples:<br/>
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Archer is checking out the site of a monster attack. There's blood and<br/>
                guts all over the place, and police have walked in and out of the area.<br/>
                Archer starts trying to track where the monster went after the attack.<br/>
                What does she discover?<br/><br/>
                Chris realises that a ghul is sneaking up on him, so he gets out his<br/>
                sawn-off shotgun and blasts it in the face as it leaps for him. Does Chris<br/>
                get hurt? How badly? What about the ghul?<br/><br/>
                A roof beam comes down on Ted as a giant spider smashes through the<br/>
                wall and scampers to freedom. Rainer grabs a chair and tries to wedge<br/>
                the beam so there's room for Ted to escape. Does she succeed? How<br/>
                badly is Ted hurt? Is he trapped?<br/>
            </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>You Have to Make the Move</h1>
            <h2>
                A key element of the use of moves is “you have to make the move.”<br/>
                This means that if you want to (for instance) manipulate someone in<br/>
                the game, you need to describe your hunter doing that. How do you<br/>
                ask? What do you offer, to make them do what you want? Why would<br/>
                they believe your offer is genuine?<br/>
                For example:<br/>
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Alan, the Keeper: “The flayed one is racing you to the car, and it looks
                like it's going to get to you before you can close the door. So Mark, what
                do you do now?”<br/>
                Mary, playing her hunter Mark: “I kick some ass!”<br/>
                Alan: “What are you doing?”<br/>
                Mary: “I'm going to smash it out the way with my baseball bat so I can
                get in the car.”<br/>
                Alan: “That sounds like you're not really getting into a fight: what's
                most important? Killing the flayed one or getting to the car?”<br/>
                Mary: “Oh, yeah, killing it I guess. I'll stop running and just start
                smashing it on the head.”<br/>
                Alan: “Sure. The flayed one brandishes its skinning knife as it grabs
                you. It screams, 'You will become one of us now, hunter!' Now roll kick
                ass.”<br/>
            </h3>
            <h2>
                It works the other way too – if you are describing what you are doing,<br/>
                someone might notice that you are making one of the moves. In that<br/>
                case, go ahead and roll the dice to see what happens.<br/>
                For example:
            </h2>
            <h3>
                Alan: “Okay, you get to the place the body was found. You can still see
                some bloodstains on the concrete, and there's some scratches there that
                might be related to the attack.”<br/>
                Mary: “I want to carefully check the bloodstains, to work out how she
                was killed. Like is it a blood spray from a torn throat or did she bleed
                out slowly from a wound or what?”<br/>
                Alan: “That sounds like you're investigating a mystery. Why don't
                you roll?”<br/>
            </h3>
            <h2>
                Sometimes the Keeper will ask you questions to clarify what's going<br/>
                on. That's cool; for the game to work, everyone needs to clearly<br/>
                understand what's happening, so make sure your answer in as much<br/>
                detail as you can.
            </h2>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Rolling the Dice</h1>
            <h2>
                Often the rules for a move will tell you to roll, say, +Cool. This means<br/>
                you should grab two everyday six-sided dice, roll them, add them<br/>
                together and then add whatever number is written down for your<br/>
                hunter's Cool.
                If it says something else instead of Cool (usually another rating), then<br/>
                add that number instead. So, if you are told to roll +Weird, roll two dice<br/>
                and add your Weird rating. If you are told to roll +Tough, roll two dice<br/>
                and add your Tough rating. If you have a negative rating, like -1, then<br/>
                you subtract one from your total instead.<br/>
                The move description will say what the different results mean. Usually,<br/>
                7 or higher is good, and 10 or higher is really good. A result of 6 or<br/>
                lower is a miss, and means the Keeper will have an opportunity to<br/>
                screw your hunter over.<br/>
                Example:<br/>
            </h2>
            <h3>
                The Keeper to roll “manipulate someone.” That's a +Charm roll, and your<br/>
                Charm is +1. You roll the dice and get a 2 and a 5. Your total is 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.<br/>
                That's a partial success for manipulate someone.<br/>
            </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            <h1>Bonuses and Hold</h1>
            <h2>
                Sometimes a move will give you a bonus to future dice rolls: you get<br/> 
                to take the bonus “forward” or “ongoing.”<br/> 
                Sometimes a move will give you a “hold.”
            </h2>
            <h1>Forward</h1>
            <h2>If you get +1 forward, you get +1 on your very next roll only.</h2>
            <h3>
                For example, another hunter can give you a bonus of +1 forward as the<br/>
                result of a move. The next thing that happens is that you charge in to<br/>
                attack a monster. You get +1 on your kick some ass roll. If you had<br/>
                decided to use magic instead, to cast a protection spell, then you would<br/>
                have gained the +1 on that roll. Once you have used the bonus, it's
                gone.
            </h3>
            <h1>Ongoing</h1>
            <h2>If you get +1 ongoing, you get +1 to every roll you make until the situation no longer applies.</h2>
            <h3>
                For example, if you read a bad situation, you might be awarded +1<br/>
                ongoing while using an escape route you spotted. You get +1 on all rolls<br/>
                while escaping via that route, but nothing more once you have escaped.<br/>
                You also get no bonus if you don't try to escape that way.
            </h3>
            <h1>Hold</h1>
            <h2>
                When you get a hold, you'll get a number of points. Each point can be<br/>
                spent one-for-one to get a specific effect. The move will list the effects<br/>
                you can spend your hold on. 
            </h2>
            <h3>
                For example, you are interviewing monster attack witnesses and make<br/>
                an investigate a mystery roll. Your result gives you 3 hold that can be<br/>
                spent to ask the Keeper questions from the list in the move.<br/>
                You ask a witness, “Did you see where the attacker went?” and spend<br/>
                one hold. (“Where did it go?” is one of the questions.)<br/>
                The Keeper says (as Mrs Henderson, the witness), “It scurried over<br/>
                there, and pulled up that grating and went into the sewers.”<br/>
                As the conversation with the witnesses continues, you spend the next<br/>
                hold to ask the Keeper about the monster's powers. “Hey, from all the<br/>
                things they've told me, can I work out any powers?” (“What can it do?”
                is another question.)<br/>
                The Keeper replies, “The witness descriptions don't agree at all. It must<br/>
                be able to change shape or maybe change memories.”<br/>
                Later the last hold goes to ask the Keeper about whether a witness is<br/>
                hiding something. That exhausts your hold, so you don't get any more
                questions for now.
